***  Variables  ***

x=2 #int  assigning 2 to x,assigning value
y=5 #int 
# Python is a dynamically typed language,you don't need to specify the type of variable,whatever content you are assigning to a variable the that content decides the type.
xy=7.2 #float
# We need to assign the names of the variables descriptive way for readability.
c=2+4j #complex
s="hellow" #string 
# Double quotes or single quotes no difference between them.
# String is a sequance of characthers
s="12" #string
a,b=4,5.0 #mutliple assignment #a is a int #b is a float because of the decimal points
# Each variable keeps a space in memory. To free this space, we delete the variables we no longer use from the memory with this command.
del x 
print("x") #error
# We can see how many variable that we have rn in the memory with this command
%whos
x=5 #int
x=5.7 #float it changed now
print(type(x)) #<class 'int'>

***  Operators  ***


+ addition           // floor or integer division (10//3=3 just quotient)
- subtraction        ** to the power of
/ division
% mod (27%5=2)
* multiplication

# tab completion
# esc m to markdown
# shift enter to new cell
# float > integer so 6+3.2= float
# if you don't assign your variable anywhere like you code directly like 10/3 it is assigning to _(underscore) by default
# underscore is contains most recent variable or operator that we've created
# we shouldn't assign anything to _ because we can't use python built in proparties properly
# we can start with a underscore when we named the variables but nothing else
# camelNotation

***  Type Bool and Comparisons  ***

# bool = True,False
# and(binary operator it takes two),or,not(unary operator it just takes one variable)
not(True) = False
# only one equal sign means assignment =,two equal sign means we are checking wheter the two values are equal or not ==
# != not equal the result is true if the two variables are different from each other

!!! 3==3.0  TRUE !!!
# because they are comparing the values by discarding the decimal points.
# int gets implicitly converted to float in this case.
